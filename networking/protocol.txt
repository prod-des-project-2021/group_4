UPD game protocol

Packets consist of default IP and UDP headers, protocol header and the payload.
IP and UDP headers are just standard and we do not really care about them.

The protocol header
Protocol header consists of 10 bytes.

Packet structure
| Protocol identifier(1B) | Priority(1B) | Sequence no.(4B) | Type(2B) | Payload length(2B) | Payload(1-512B)

Protocol identified: 	  1 byte for protocol identifier.
Priority: 		          Short integer to tell if the packet needs to be aknowledged.1: (Quaranteed delivery) 0: (fire and forget)
Sequence no.:		      Sequence number for each packet. Client can ignore packets arriving late if priority = 0
Type:			          Payload type for parsing the payload
Payload length:		      Payload length for parsing the payload (max 65,536 but due to fragmentation, real limit is around 1500)
Payload:		          Any binary encoded data.

Example:

     | Protocol identifier(1B) | Priority(1B) | Sequence no.(4B) | Type(2B | Payload length(2B) | Payload(1-512B)
CON  | f1                      | 01           | 00 00 00 01      | 00 01   | 00 01              | 00 <- dummy payload
ACK  | f1                      | 00           | 00 00 00 01      | 00 03   | 00 04              | 00 00 00 01 <- acked packet seq
ACT  | f1                      | 01           | 00 00 00 02      | 00 06   | 00 08              | 00 0C 1A 14 00 0B 12 0A
ACK  | f1                      | 00           | 00 00 00 02      | 00 03   | 00 04              | 00 00 00 02 <- acked packet seq

Acknowledgement of packet arrival
Receiver must send ACK message to the other party when some messages priority is set to 1
The message is sent again until ACK for that message is received.
In case the ACK packet gets dropped the receiver must ignore the re sent requests and send the ACK packet again.
